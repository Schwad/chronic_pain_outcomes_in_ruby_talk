      Why was the symbol of all that is whimsical and right with programming. The
      whimsy that is core to ruby; the care about the building and the art. He represented
      a time where you could give major conference talks without sharing your job title,
      real name or location.

      I lost several days trying to set things up nicely on my machines. Talk about strategy.

      Several assumptions.

      Yes, a lot of 2008-2009 ruby packages will struggle to just "run" on a new macbook. many scripts, however, still will work.

      There are a lot of pitfalls, you want all dependencies to be as close to 2009 centric as possibe.

      This had one dependency, which I installed manually. Installing something with a *lot* of dependencies could get tricky and would require something more elegant

      ```
      # see code
      nano markaby_example_1.rb

      # run it
      ruby markaby_example_1.rb | tidy

      --> note; rubygems was made by a collection of people including chad fowler, david alan black and jim weirich at rubyconf 2004
