# In order:

1. Lay out a non-business 'problem' through a story

--

2. Discuss attacking that problem with the help of 'Ruby' 🍖

--

3. Cover outcomes and retrospective observations

--

4. Underline the importance of using your Ruby 'superpower' ❤️

## It's not a choice between 'working for the man' and 'toy projects'
## Not everyone can do what you do
## What is a few minutes of mindless scripting for you may be life changing for someone else
## Your gift was not just to argue with fellow employees over antipatterns on PRs

## Reformatting the iterations with regards to messaging user (3-4 slides of code)

## Setting up things for machine learning (3-4 slides, include original blog that inspired me and show code)

## The final run through (3-4 slides to get results working)

## Final conclusions only 24% going together

## However, never under a 4 under x
