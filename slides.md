1. Lay out a non-business 'problem' through a story

--

2. Discuss attacking that problem with the help of 'Ruby' 🍖

--

3. Cover outcomes and retrospective observations

4. Underline the importance of using your Ruby 'superpower' ❤️

# 2. Solving this problem, with the aid of Ruby
---

## unit of measure, millibar vs. inches and what is ACTUALLY metric. make america joke.
## GOAL: forecasting someday
## setting up the app
## twilio
## why no web interface
## Handling user error

---

## Reformatting the iterations with regards to messaging user (3-4 slides of code)

## Setting up things for machine learning (3-4 slides, include original blog that inspired me and show code)

## The final run through (3-4 slides to get results working)

## Final conclusions only 24% going together

## However, never under a 4 under x
