Why was the symbol of all that is whimsical and right with programming. The
whimsy that is core to ruby; the care about the building and the art. He represented
a time where you could give major conference talks without sharing your job title,

# we aren't met to use the old stuff, but I want it

-- lets get ruby 1.8.7
-- can't do it with chruby, maybe with rvm
-- ruby-build doesn't have it either
-- greatest hurdle, getting an old ruby!
-- major complaints on 1.8.7 with RVM; however they said that might be possible in a vm or containerized linux. no thanks!
-- attempted rbenv
-- rvm just full of bugs

(rbenv worked out of the box for 1.9.3 (screenshot))
downgrade rubygems to 1.3.5
sudo gem update --system 1.3.5
rvm pkg install zlib

Rubygems 1.8.2 (circa 2011), download, cd into zip and `ruby setup.rb` (screenshot1)

# Might ask for libyaml

`rvm pkg install libyaml`

# Getting your ruby rocking with the right openssl

brew install rbenv/tap/openssl@1.0

# New error

`Error running '__rvm_make -j16',`

# Kill your rubies, use libyaml from homebrew
(screenshot3)

# Get ubuntu 10.04 (2011)
vagrant init bento/ubuntu-10.04
vagrant up
vagrant ssh

*we are in the machine*  

# Apt-get udpate will *not* work out of the box

* this is a blocker to getting ruby, installing rbenv, etc.

# Replace sources.list with new repos which make it work
cd etc/apt
sed -i -e 's#http://us.archive.ubuntu.com#http://old-releases.ubuntu.com#g' sources.list
nano sources.list
sed -i -e 's#http://security.ubuntu.com#http://old-releases.ubuntu.com#g' sources.list

# You won't have "apt install", do old way of "apt-get"

# debugging ruby in the past

When we're over a decade ago, you absolutely cannot rely on anything to be reliable. You don't want any new packaging. Even google will let you down, search like this:

`before:2012-01-01 install ruby on ubuntu` <<screenshot>>

`rubygems -> 1.3.5`
`ruby -> 1.8.7`

# rubygems taking forever. can I get git and clone it down, build and run the gem locally? maybe the best

# Let's get git

sudo apt-get install git-core

# git clone does not work

```

sudo wget --no-check-certificate --content-disposition http://rubygems.org/downloads/builder-2.0.0.gem

walk through the old code, run the code, get the screenshots, pull this into getting 'old' ruby running



# use ruby-dev

sudo apt-get install ruby-dev




rbenv, instead of rvm

I am not a twilio expert.

That's the point.
